## Introduction

Hello, in this repo you will find code that produces a comma delimited list of numbers and group them into a range when they are sequential. The collection i chose to do so was a TreeSet. I chose thise because it is memory efficient because it automatically sorts all the input i give it and it avoids duplicates. This is good because it prevents us from writing code for sorting the input and checking for duplicates which prevents us from wasting memory.

## SummarizeNumbers.java Methods

In this class I implemented 4 methods, 2 of which are implemented from an Interface and 2 of which are Helper functions.

Looking at the "collect" method, it designed to take a string of comma separated numbers and convert them into integers.
